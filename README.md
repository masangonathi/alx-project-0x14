To obtain an API key, sign up on the MoviesDatabase developer portal and generate one under your account settings.

## Error Handling

Common error responses:

400 Bad Request: Occurs when the request is malformed. Example:

{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Invalid parameters."
}

401 Unauthorized: Occurs when the API key is missing or invalid.

404 Not Found: Returned when the requested resource is not available.

429 Too Many Requests: Triggered when the rate limit is exceeded.

To handle these errors in your code, use try-catch blocks and inspect the status code to determine the appropriate action.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

Rate Limits: The API allows up to 1,000 requests per day for free-tier accounts. Premium accounts have higher limits.

Caching: To optimize performance and reduce unnecessary requests, cache frequently accessed data locally.

Pagination: Use the pagination parameters (page, limit) to fetch large datasets efficiently.

Error Retry: Implement exponential backoff for retrying requests in case of temporary errors (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).

Secure API Key: Store your API key in environment variables or secret management systems to prevent unauthorized access.
